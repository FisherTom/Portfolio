            Mushi is a mobile app designed to help people find and identify wild
            mushrooms. The aplication uses the MERN stack and was completed as a
            final project during the Northcoders Full-stack development boot
            camp.
            <br />
            <br />
            Users can submit mushroom sightings providing a location, picture, a
            description and the species they believe the mushroom to be. Users
            are then able to browse sightings via the map screen, filtering
            results by species.
            <br />
            <br />
            On the mushroom sighting screen users can vote for a species they
            believe the mushroom to be, the back-end will set the species
            assigned to the sighting to the species with the highest votes
            automatically. The back-end also calculates a species credibility
            score based on the number of votes for the assigned species and the
            number of conflicting votes.
